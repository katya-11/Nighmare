Day by day
Desparate fight
My fears are waiting for me at the outside
Overwhelmed, feeling low
I'm the star in this depressing one man show

Wish I would be able
To flee but I'm not stable
Wouldn't stand a chance its just too much to handle
I need an inspiration
Another world I have to see
I travel with my portal station to a place of fantasy
